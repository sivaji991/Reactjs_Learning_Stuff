What is Hooks?

  Hooks are special functionns, that allow us to use state and other React feature in functional components.
  Earlier, When we used to create react app using Functional component, then we didn't have access to the state management and lifecycle methods.
  To access these feature we had to add class components.
  So, this was the problem eith the functional component.
  But after intoducing React Hooks from version 16.8, we can now use state management and other react features without writing class components.
  
  In other words, Hooksare the functions that make functional components work like class components.

  Hooks made react functional components easy to use.

  Developers prefer functional components over class components.

  Benifits of React Hooks=>

    React hooks simplify the code, improves the readability, reusability and overall performance of the application.

----------------

Most commonly used hooks are:
  1.  useState
  2.  useEffect
  3.  useRef
  4.  useMemo
  5.  useCallback
  6.  useContext
  7.  useReducer
  8.  useLayoutEffect
  9.  custom hook

  -------------

1.  useState =>

      useState is a react hook, which creates an 'state varriable'. Which helps us to track state in components & updates the user interface when state changes.

2.  useEffect =>
      useEffect hook allows you to perform side effects in your components.

    Some examples of side effects are:
    - Ferching the data from API
    - Directly updating the DOM
    - Timers like SetTimeOut and SetInterval

3.  useRef =>
      useRef is a react hook that allow us to create mutable variable which not re-render the component.

      useRef is also used for accessing DOM elements.

4.  useMemo =>
      useMemo Hook returns a memoized value.
      (it's like caching a value so that it doesn't need to be recalculated)

      The useMemo hook only runs when one of its dependencies gets updated

      This can improve the performance of the application. There is one more hook in react to improve performance, that is useCallback hook .

      The useMemo and useCallback hooks are similar. The main difference is :
        - useMemo returns a memoized value.
        - useCallback returns a memoized function.


5.  useCallback =>
      It is React hook that lets you cache a function definition between re-renders.
      it means, when we use the useCallback hook, it doesn't create multiple instance of same function when re-render happenss.

      Instead of creating new instance of the function, it provides the cached function on re-render of the component.

6.  useContext =>
      It is a React hook that allows you to access data from any component without explicitly passing it down through props at every level. 

      simply: 
      useContext is used to manage Global data in the React APP.

7.  useReducer =>
      It is similar to useState, But Instead of providing state and setter function. It provides state and dispatch function

      The useReducer hook accepts two arguments 
          - Reducer function
          - Initial state
          and returns: Current state and dispatch method

      The Reducer function is the function that specifies how the state gets updated
